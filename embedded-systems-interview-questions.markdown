# Embedded Systems Interview Questions

This page features a curated list of **embedded systems interview questions**, selected from our free technical book, *Circuits and Code*. Whether you're preparing for an **embedded systems job interview** or refreshing your knowledge in areas like **firmware development**, **electrical engineering**, or **real-time systems**, these questions cover essential topics for embedded system engineers. 

You can find **detailed answers and explanations in the full book**, available on our <a href="{{ '/download/' | relative_url }}">download page</a>.

## Topics Covered
The questions cover topics such as:
- Embedded C fundamentals
- Microcontroller architecture
- RTOS concepts
- Communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART, CAN)
- Debugging and testing
- Power and performance optimization
- Real-world problem-solving

## Embedded Systems Interview Questions

1. Implement a function to validate the parity of a bitstream.  
2. How would you sense the voltage of a battery with a microcontroller?  
3. What is an interrupt service routine (ISR), and how do they differ from regular functions in implementation?  
4. Draw a circuit to control a LED from a microcontroller GPIO pin.  
5. Explain the following C keywords: `volatile`, `const`, and `static`.  
6. What type of signal would be best for transferring data from a sensor located 1 meter away to a microcontroller?  
7. Implement a PID controller in C and discuss its typical applications.  
8. Compare and contrast I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface).  
9. Implementing a bit-banged SPI master.  
10. Describe how to use an oscilloscope to measure a signal.
